# python packages

> **geometry** package that contains a **geoshape** module
   this module contains several functions used for calculation such as the perimeter,
   the area or the Volume for different geometric shapes ...
   (value of **pi** used for calculation: **3.14**)

> It consists of 3 parts :

1.  Perimeter
2.  Area
3.  Volume

> PART 1 is composed of several functions for perimeter calculation :

- **square_perimeter(length)** who returns the perimeter of a square
- **circle_perimeter(radius)** who returns the perimeter of a  circle
- **perimeter_rectangle(length, width)** which returns the perimeter of a rectangle
- **perimeter_triangle(triangle_base, triangle_side1, triangle_side2)** which returns the perimeter of some triangle

> PART 2 is composed of several functions for area calculation

- **square_area(length)** which returns the area of a square
- **circle_area(radius)** which returns the area of a circle
- **rectangle_area(length, width)** which returns the area of a rectangle
- **triangle_area(triangle_base, triangle_side1, triangle_side2)** which returns the area of some triangle

> PART 3 is composed of several functions for volume calculation

- **cube_volume(radius)** which returns the volume of a cube
- **sphere_volume(radius)** which returns the volume of a sphere
